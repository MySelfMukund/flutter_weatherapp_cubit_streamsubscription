# Flutter Weather App (Cubit + StreamSubscription)

A weather application built with Flutter that utilizes the **Bloc(Cubit)** state management pattern along with **StreamSubscription** to provide real-time weather updates for any given location.

## Features

- Fetch and display current weather information for any city.
- Real-time updates on weather conditions using **StreamSubscription**.
- Clean and responsive UI with a modern design.
- Supports searching for cities and retrieving weather data.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or Visual Studio Code (for development)
- An API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) or another weather service

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MySelfMukund/flutter_weatherapp_cubit_streamsubscription.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd flutter_weatherapp_cubit_streamsubscription

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   
5. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run

### Project Structure
Here's an overview of the project folder structure:
   ```plaintext
   lib/
   ├── cubits/             # Contains Cubits and Bloc logic
   ├── models/             # Data models for weather data
   ├── repository/         # API handling and data retrieval logic
   ├── presentations/      # UI screens for displaying weather information
   ├── widgets/            # Reusable UI components
   ├── services/           # Api calling service modules    
   └── main.dart           # Main entry point
```

## How It Works

- **Bloc Pattern** is used for managing the state of tasks in the app, ensuring separation of concerns and cleaner code.
- **StreamSubscription** listens for task changes in real time and updates the UI accordingly.
- **Repository Layer** handles data persistence, ensuring that tasks are stored and retrieved efficiently.

## State Management

- **Bloc/Cubit:** Used to manage state changes for tasks (add, delete, update).
- **StreamSubscription:** Listens to task updates and streams them to the UI for real-time interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter** - Cross-platform development framework
- **Bloc (Cubit)** - State management
- **StreamSubscription** - For real-time updates and task management
